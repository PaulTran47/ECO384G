## Overview
This repository houses all problem sets and associated solutions for ECO384G: Business Cycle Analysis at UT Austin, in fall 2021 (problem sets 1 and 3) and ECO384G: Business Cycles and Policy in spring 2022 (problem sets 4 - 7). The solutions are written in Matlab by Paul Le Tran.

Problem set 1 is from Professor Oli Coibion. Problem set 3 is from Professor Andres Drenik. Problem sets 4-5 are from Professor Nitya Pandalai-Nayar. Problem sets 6-7 are from Professor Christoph Boehm.

# Problem Set 2
In the fall 2021 semester, it was decided that there was not to be a second problem set for the class. This section is still included to signal that a second problem set should be expected unless told otherwise like in said semester.
